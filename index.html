            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I've been working with dogs professionally for more than 15 years, helping hundreds of owners build stronger relationships with their furry companions. My passion for dogs started at a young age, and I've dedicated my career to understanding canine behavior, training, and holistic wellness.</p>
                
                <p>I believe every dog has the potential to be well-behaved and happy. My approach combines professional training expertise with holistic wellness, focusing on positive reinforcement, nutrition, and understanding each dog's unique personality and energy.</p>

                        <p class="review-text">"Look at this cutie pie. Can you even tell that he is aggressive towards dogs?<br /><br/>
                        Bailey, was adopted by us after being dumped several times by previous adopters because he was aggressive towards dogs. Being a pure golden retriever, he is suppose to be loving and caring towards dogs.
Unfortunately, this does not apply to Bailey. He has forgotten his root. In fact he acts as if he is a hunter. To be exact, killer...He wants to kill every dogs and cats that he sees. Especially when we decided to move my grandma and her baby poodle in with us. We started to reach out to trainers and even animal communicator. We started to understand his behaviour and try really hard to educate him how should a golden behave. Yes, we needed to teach him to be a golden. We are really glad to meet his trainers - Terrence from @inspiredogacademy in helping us to get Bailey back. To bring back our good and obedient Golden Retriever. To let us understand better on Bailey. We, as his owners, always get questions like: is it hard to handle this? Yes, it takes time and effort but this does not give you an excuse to abandon him."</p>
